        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
          Realm Runner is a Sonic-like action platformer made in Unreal Engine 5.4. Written in Blueprint, my main work revolves around creating a player controller that can maintain a sense of momentum and velocity while also reacting to and adapting to level geometry with dynamic gravity.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In addition, I developed both the homing attack system and the item system. The homing attack utilizes interfaces, while the item system makes use of inheritance to make designing and integrating new items and targetable objects easier for designers.

              </div>
              <p class="project-description">
                Player movement can be broken down into three main sections: determining the direction of gravity, adjusting the movement vectors to match the new gravity, and aligning the camera with the new gravity.
                </br>
                </br>
                First, the player fires a short line trace underneath their feet to see if they're touching the floor. If a hit is successful, the inverse of the normal of the hit object gives us the new direction of gravity. This vector is normalized to a length of 1 to prevent any issues while changing gravity.
                </br>
                </br>
                Then, the player's forward movement vector must be adjusted to match the new gravity. This is determined by getting the unit vector of the distance from the player to a forward point, which is attached to the player's character. The player always moves "forward," so to speak, using their movement to turn towards the desired movement direction.
                </br>
                </br>
                Finally, the camera must be updated to smoothly follow the player's gravity. The camera is attached to a root node, which is detached from the player, and then has its position and rotation updated to match the player's location and current gravity direction, respectively. Finally, if the player is moving fast enough, their forward-looking direction is determined from the current camera Z rotation, as well as player movement input.

              </div>
              <p class="project-description">
                One of the biggest challenges of designing a homing attack system is determining how an object in the world becomes a target. 
                </br>
                </br>
                For Realm Runner, I decided that using interfaces would be the most ideal solution. This is mainly due to two reasons: firstly, interfaces allow the homing attack system to not know about what it is targeting, just that it is targeting something. Secondly, by letting objects define their own targetability behavior, an interface scales with an object's complexity.
                </br>
                </br>
                Each targetable object implements a BPI_Targetable interface, which has a single function, TargetFunctionality, that returns a Vector3 targetPosition. The homing attack function calls TargetFunctionality to get the world space position of a targetable object, which is used to ultimately determine the homing attack target.
                </br>
                </br>
                Another aspect of the homing attack system is the selection algorithm. Using the dot product, it is possible to determine how closely the player is looking at a given targetable object. The object with the highest dot product is chosen as the target.

              <p class="project-description">
                After finishing each level, the player is presented with a choice between three different items, each of which provides the player with a unique power. The item system is split into two parts, being individual item logic and item storage.  
                </br>
                </br>
                For individual items, all items inherit from an abstract base item class that defines a few parameters that all items have, such as a name, description, and icon. All items can be called by a base event OnItemActivate, which is used to activate and drive the logic for items. Inheritance is used as a way to ensure that all items share a common way to be activated, as well as a common set of characteristics. 
                </br>
                </br>
                As for item storage, an inventory system is created to store items between levels by reading and writing inventory data to a persistent game manager.
