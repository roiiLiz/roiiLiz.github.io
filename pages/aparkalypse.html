                <p>
                  One of the jam's biggest highlights for me was the two hour section on the final day where everyone got to play eachother's games. It was super fascinating seeing how people interpreted the theme of the jam, as well as getting to talk to the game's creators. There was a clear passion present in many of the teams, and it shows in their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another highlight of the jam was my teammates. The game jam served as a very unique bonding experience for all of us, and it was really fun getting to know my teammates.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges I faced as part of this jam was the time factor. The 48 hour time frame put a ton of pressure on all of us, especially since this jam was our first for my team. It was very stressful, but in the same way that exercising is "stressful": pushing yourself to your limits, but for coding instead of cardio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another challenge specific to my work as a programmer was implementing the cart logic for the player's units. Essentially, units are grouped into carts, with the right-most cart being designated as the head. Implementing this into engine took a fair bit of time, which would've been very nice to have in the final parts of development.

                <p>
                  Overall, I had an absolute blast at this jam, and I am super excited to participate in a 2026 FIEA Game Jam. The jam pushed me and my team to our limits, and gave us plenty of opportunities to meet new people and get valuable feedback from people with experience in the field.
